Introduction

Note Book Site  http://127.0.0.1:8000/
This site is designed for the convenience of keeping your notes.
Thanks to it, the user can create, update, delete and read his notes on the Note page.
Logout allows the user to leave the site, after which the "Go to the login page" page will open. Only registered user can login. Users cannot register through the login/registration page.
For administrators, additional functions are opened, such as the admin panel.
Notes of other users, created users, groups, their permissions and recent activities that the admin can see in the admin panel.
You can read information about this site on its About page
The site is functionally convenient. It has a header where you can click Note, Create, Update, Delete, 
About Us, Admin Panel (for admin users) and open a separate page that has a bottom panel with the text "Created by the Main Academy".
The Notebook application, developed by Main Academy, is a versatile and user-friendly tool designed to help users organize their notes, 
tasks, and ideas efficiently. This application aims to improve productivity by providing a simple and intuitive interface for managing daily information. 
It offers many features such as note-taking, classification, groups creation and synchronization across multiple devices, allowing users to access notes anytime, anywhere.
The purpose of this test plan is to describe testing strategies and approaches to verify the functionality, performance, and reliability of the Notebook application.
This document describes in detail the purpose, scope, testing methods, and resources needed to conduct comprehensive testing. 
The goal is to make sure that your application meets the highest quality standards and provides the best user experience.
The main objectives of this test plan are::
1. Functional Testing: Make sure that all the functions of the Notebook app are working properly.
2. Performance Testing: Evaluate the performance and stability of the application in various conditions.
3. Compatibility test: Make sure that the application works correctly on different devices and on different operating systems.
4. Usability Testing: Evaluate the usability and overall experience with your application.
5. Security Testing: Identify and eliminate potential vulnerabilities in your application.

Features not to be tested
This is a listing of what is NOT to be tested and features that will be tested in future versions:

Deletion of the account.
Navigation without using a mouse.
Colors of the interface.
Grammar/spelling.
Highlighting text.
Changing of the cursor type after hovering on clickable elements.
Scaling.
Reactions of the clickable elements after hovering the cursor..
Colors of the interface.
Logo.







These features are not included in this version of the software due to their low risk and production impact. And also due to the stable successful use of these features previously.
Approach
 
The objective of  testing is to make sure that the website works according to  the requirements, and no significant errors appear.
Our testing approach is designed to ensure compliance with the functional requirements of the site for creating, 
updating, and deleting notes, as well as managing users and their permissions. We will also conduct regression testing to 
ensure that new versions do not impact previously implemented features. 
During this testing we use Exploratory testing that means we will create high-level test cases for testing each version and 
low-level regression test cases based on fixed bugs for re-checking broken below places.
The website must pass all the planned tests. Only in this case its quality can be assured.
 
 





The main testing types that will be executed in the project are:
 
1.	Authentication and Authorization Testing: Verify user login with correct credentials and ensure 
access to the admin panel is restricted to users with appropriate permissions.
 
2.	Testing Note Creation, Update, and Deletion: Ensure notes can be created, updated, and deleted correctly and are sorted by creation date.
 
3.	Administrative Panel Testing: Verify functionalities for adding, updating, and deleting users , also ensure administrators can manage notes.

4.	Regression Testing: Recheck fixed bugs and ensure new changes do not affect existing functionalities through high-level and low-level test cases.

Testing Tasks

1. Creating a test plan and high-level test cases (checklist) based on requirements. This helps ensure that all base functionality is covered and that potential edge cases are accounted for.

2. Executing high-level test cases and recording results. Using exploratory testing for coverage which not identified by checklists. 
This allows for the identification of defects that can then be addressed.
 Bugs Life Cycle / Bug statuses
New/Open - Created bug.
In progress - Dev is fixing a bug.
Ready for QA - Wait to check the fix of the bug. (check the fixed version)
QA in progress - QA in progress to check the fix of the bug.
Fixed/Closed - QA verified.
Re-opened - QA failed, bug is reproduced after fixing.
Invalid - It is not a bug.
Can`t reproduce - I try to reproduce but I can`t. Re-check steps.
Won`t fix  - It`s a bug, but unfortunately, it won`t fix during the following 5 versions
!!! Don't delete ANY bug (invalid, can`t reproduce, duplicated, won`t fix…any!)

3. Reporting defects to developers. This allows developers to fix defects and improve the quality of the software.

4. Creating low-level test cases based on fixed (Ready For QA status)  bugs.
 
5. Retesting after defects are fixed. This helps ensure that defects have been properly fixed and that the software functions as expected.

6. Executing low-level test cases ( they have the highest priority) and high-level test cases on each new version 

7. Documenting results. This provides a record of what has been tested, what defects were found, and what the final software quality is. (Comparing created to fixed defects)
